# Games supporting Medals

## These games support the Medals system

- Star Story
- The Fairy Tale REVAMPED
- The Secrets of Dyrt.NET
(planned)
- Cynthia Johnson
- Star Story II

## These games can offer extras based on the achievements you scored in ANY game of mine

- The Fairy Tale REVAMPED (Anna's Temple will contain bonusses)
- The Secrets of Dyrt.NET (5 extra dungeons unlocking based on your total achievement score)
(planned)
- Star Story II (however no full plans yet)



## Notes
- The Fairy Tale was in remake when this document was set up. The old version has no support, the new version has.
- Saved Games that were made prior to the medal system being supported in the respective games (conserns Star Story and Dyrt.NET most of all) will synchronize automatically on loading the Save Game or otherwise very soon when you play the game.
- The games only use the internet to make sure the Medal Data is up to date. They do not send any data (other than the request data that is required to make a call), however Firewalls can still block this out.
- Games that were using the Game Jolt API before won't be able to do so anymore. And no, older versions won't be able to do that either, so don't even try it.
