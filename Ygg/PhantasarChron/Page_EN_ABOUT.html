The Phantasar Chronices is a series of novels all taking place on the fictional world of Phantasar.
<p>
The world of Phantasar is different from the "real" world in many ways. Other people live their, they have their own languages, their own cultures, religion and history, but in the same time Phantasar has a lot in common with our world.
<p>
The books were written in a style aiming to be easy to read. The novels mix personal development with adventure and all of that may also have a tiny bit of romance. The stories also have a good sense of humor, however the aim is not to turn it into satire.
<p>
With the Phantasar Chronicles you can go many ways. Who wants an easy yet fun story is well-set here. But if you want something deeper and want to look to the relations between the novels to get a good image of the history (or lore) of Phantasar and wants to know more too about the histories, religions and politics has a good way to go too. Who wants to find a "wise lesson" in the stories will surely find it, however I'm not oppressing my message, if you get what I mean.
<p>
But the Phantasar Chronicles can also be a source of inspiration. They can offer perspective to make drawings based on the books, movies or games (the so-called "fan art"). I'm pretty convinced a drawing teacher can base a task for his/her students on these stories.
<p>
Each book is a story on its own, so you can read them separately from each other without any specific order. But in the same time there are relations between the books. When you never read a book from these series before you can basically start with any book, however when you read other books already you can find the relations between the books quite easily. This formula sets the Phantasar Chronicles apart.
<p>
Most of the stories (except for a few exceptions which are all marked as such) do not aim for a specific age group making them fun for a young and older audience.
<p>
All in all, everyone willing to open his/her mind to a world where dreams and fantasy unfold will enjoy the Phantasar Chronicles.

Jeroen Petrus Broks, author of the Phantasar Chronicles was born on June 19th, 1975 in Breda, the Netherlands. 
<p>
He is the eldest of two children and always interested in writing stories. Fascinated by fantasy world setting up the world of Phantasar was only a small step for him, as he can vent a lot of inspiration on who this world works. Aside from the stories themselves he thinks a lot about the cultures, religions and political systems which are common on Phantasar. 
<p>
Aside from a novel writer he is also a php web developer. He also can be found working with C# and Lua (and his homemade variant to it: NIL) as well developing homemade games.

He also likes to play darts and pool and acting in humorous sketches.

"Living in reality is good, but never forget to fantasize"
