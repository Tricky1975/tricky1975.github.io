	<h1 align=center>Anna's Temple</h1>
	<h2 align=center>Through a full Anna account</h2>
	First introduced in "The Fairy Tale REVAMPED", several games written by Jeroen P. Broks, feature Anna's Temple. Where (the initial version) of The Fairy Tale REVAMPED only allows access with an Anna account, later games, may also allow access with a Game Jolt, account <a href='GameJolt.html'>(click here for detailed info about access to Anna's Temple with a Game Jolt account)</a>.
	In Anna's Temple rooms with treasure are available depending on how well you've performed in all games that can contact Anna. Anna will give points based on the earned achievements and also on leaderboards hosted on Anna.
	The games being watched by Anna are (since the last revisiion of this document):
	<ol type=i>
		<!--
		<li>Scyndi's Forest Quest</li>
		<li>The Secrets of Dyrt</li>
		-->
		<li>Star Story</li>
		<li>BallPlay Cupid</li>
		<li>The Fairy Tale REVAMPED</li>
		<li>Cynthia Johnson</li>
		<li>Sixty-Three Fires of Lung</li>
		<li>Who is the Virus?</li>
	</ol>
	All these games are able to create an Anna account when you log in with the same credentials you can access Anna here too. 
	<p>Anna is a bot living on my server, named after "Boten Anna" by Basshunter. She can reward people who do well by extra items in RPG games, and ban people who try to cheat the leaderboards, or other wise try to fool her.

	A few notes about using an Anna account in general and in relation with Anna's Temple.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>Anna uses Gravatar for avatars on her own site. You should be aware of that.</li>
		<li>Anna will automatically terminate accounts which have been inactive too long, accounts banned for some time will even be completely removed.</li>
		<li>Anna can ban accounts by administrators order, but also on her own accord. Banned accounts will NOT get you access into Anna's temple.</li>
		<li>When Anna bans accounts leaderboard scores will mostly be deleted instantly. When an Anna account is removed, either due to being banned too long or by request of the account owner, all data tied to the account will immediately disappear with it.</li>
		<li>What Anna is willing to give you for your efforts can change, as the system may be reconfigured every now and then. Balancing issues based on how many points are possible or difficulty issues can play a role here.</li>
		<li>When you create an Anna account it belongs to you and you alone. If I have any hint at all, you might be giving out your account to others, I will terminate the account immediately. Anna may also have some features available to terminate accounts due to these suspicions.</li>
		<li>The way Anna rewards you for your effort is different when you use an Anna account from when you use a Game Jolt account. This has to do with the fact that since I created Anna myself, I can more easily manipulate things, and especially when it comes to fine tuning Anna is more flexible.</li>
		<li>All data entrusted to Anna is only used to make Anna and the site she lives on function the way it should. Data is not being given out to 3rd parties, for any reason, unless I receive a legal order from court. (I'm not above the law, sorry).</li>
		<li>Contrary to GJ calculation where Anna judges you on the moment you enter the temple, Anna checks all her own accounts once every 24 hours (and will be able to be faster in the process). Coming back to Anna's temple after every trophy you get is therefore not fruitful, unless it's longer than 24h ago you obtained that trophy/achievement.</li>
		<li>There is no warranties. Anna works as-is. Under no circumstances can any party related to Anna be held liable for any bad consequences the use of the Anna system could cause.</li>
	</ol>
	That all being said, I hope this explanation is clear now ;)
