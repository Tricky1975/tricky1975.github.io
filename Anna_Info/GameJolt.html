	<h1 align=center>Anna's Temple</h1>
	<h2 align=center>With a Game Jolt account</h2>
	<p>Anna's Temple is available in Sixty-Three Fires of Lung and a few other games later than that to all Game Jolt users or people who have an Anna account.<br>
	When you solely use your Game Jolt account (plus token), Anna will scan your account for all achievements you scored in games written by Jeroen P. Broks (also known as Phantasar Productions).
	The last time this document was revised the games being scanned are:
	<ol type=i>
		<li>Scyndi's Forest Quest</li>
		<li>The Secrets of Dyrt</li>
		<li>Star Story</li>
		<li>BallPlay Cupid</li>
		<li>The Fairy Tale REVAMPED</li>
		<li>Cynthia Johnson</li>
		<li>Sixty-Three Fires of Lung</li>
		<li>Who is the Virus?</li>
	</ol>
	And possibly future games will be added to this list, as well.<br>
	The rewards Anna gives are dependent on how many trophies you got in either of these games, and if they were Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. I guess it goes without saying Platinum trophies will be taken in higher regard than bronze ones.
	<br>A few notes about how Anna judges and how Anna values your privacy
	<ol type=a>
		<li>When solely using a Game Jolt account Anna will only gather the data she needs to come to a proper judgment, and remove it from her memory immediately after. She will not save any data.</li>
		<lI>A small exception can be made when nasty bugs are being encountered in which some additional data is needed to get the bug fixed. This data will only remain on the server for 5 or 6 months and then automatically be removed. Cases in which this will happen will be very extremely rare.</lI>
		<li>No data shall be shared to third parties unless there is an order by court of law.</li>
		<li>The rewards Anna may give can vary from time to time, as reconfiguration will be done if things appear to be off-balance.</li>
		<li>Accounts banned from Game Jolt may also be rejected by Anna.</li>
		<li>Anna may also ban Game Jolt accounts from her service, by either her own accord or administrator's order. That will NOT affect your status on Game Jolt itself, but it will cause Anna to deny access to her temple.</li>
		<li>Please note, only trophies are scanned by Anna. Leaderboard scores are not. Your userlevel on Game Jolt is also not taken into account.</li>
	</ol>
	That all being said, I hope this explanation is clear now ;)
